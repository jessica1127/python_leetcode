    Binary Search Tree
    ------------------
    The Binary Search Tree represents an ordered symbol table of generic
    key-value pairs.  Keys must be comparable.  Does not permit duplicate keys.
    When assocating a value with a key already present in the BST, the previous
    value is replaced by the new one.  This implementation is for an unbalanced
    BST.
